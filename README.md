# hello-world

I'm a 22 year old student, who is passionate about coding.
I've already mastered the very basics of Webdevelopment.
This includes HTML, CSS, and the basics of Javascript.

Due to my education in the IT-Sector, I was able to learn some more languages like Basic (PHP, MySQL and JAVA).

My future plan is to get started in the Industry and become a professional Web-Developer
